# 🛠️ 45-Day Java Backend Developer Roadmap

Welcome to the **45-Day Java Backend Developer Roadmap** – a focused and actionable journey for anyone who wants to **understand how backend systems work using Java, one step at a time**.

This roadmap isn't about becoming a “master” in 45 days. Instead, it's a commitment to **daily learning**, embracing mistakes, and slowly building solid backend development skills. Technology constantly evolves, and the goal is to stay curious and consistent — not perfect.

Even when you're tired, bored, or demotivated — remind yourself:

> 💬 **“I should always stay committed, even when I don’t feel like it. Consistency over mood. – @Krishna”**

## ✅ Final Thoughts

You won't learn everything in 45 days — and that’s okay. This roadmap is designed to give you **real-world momentum**. What matters most is that you show up, build, reflect, and repeat.

Keep improving. Stay humble. Keep building.
